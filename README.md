# CCBR ChIP-Seq Pipeline


##Installation

1. install nextflow
	```bash
	curl -fsSL get.nextflow.io | bash
	```
	For details, visit https://www.nextflow.io/

2. clone this git repository
	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/CCBR/ChIP-Seq-Pipeline.git
	```

##How to run the pipeline

```bash
./nextflow run ChIP-Seq-Pipeline/main.nf \
	-config ChIP-Seq-Pipeline/config \
	--macsconfig='examples/macs.config' \
	--reads='ChIP-Seq-Pipeline/examples/*.fastq' \
	--genome='hg19'
```
	
* Note that the reads names are supposed to end with "*.fastq" or "*.fq" or "*.fastq.gz".
If you experience an error message related to missing file(s), this might be the reason.

* Config file is designed to work at our NIH biowulf2 HPC. If you plan to use on helix, add -profile 'local' option at the end of command line arguments. If you plan to use outside NIH, you need to edit the "genome" section according to your paths information.

* macs.config is a config file for MACS2 to find peaks. ChIP sample and control (input or IgG) with their label concatenated by comma form a line, e.g. chip_sample_id,control_id,sample_name. chip_sample_id or control_id are expected the basename of the FASTQ files wihtout the trailing ".fastq" or ".fastq.gz".

* Currently, the pipeline fully supports hg19, mm10 and partially supports GRCh38 and GRCm38. Contact us for other genomes. 


###Additional options can be used: 
* -resume                         --> to resume the previous failed run
* -profile 'local'                --> for running tools "locally" not thourgh high performance computer queueing mechanisms.
* -with-timeline 'timeline.html'  --> record the run time of each process.
* -with-dag 'flowchart.png'       --> draw the flowchart

We implemented the pipeline using Nextflow.

##Thanks
I got many nice implementation ideas from Nextflow examples, especially from NGI-ChIP-seq pipeline.
Many thanks to the NGI pipeline developers and our CCBR team mebers.
